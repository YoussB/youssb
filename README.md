## Hi there, I am Bishoy 👋
### 🤓 For now I am not a super active open-source engineer, but I will be back soon! 🤓
- 👨🏽‍💻 I work as the CTO of a German startup [Mytigate](https://mytigate.com)
- 🔭 I used to work on [Concourse](https://github.com/concourse) & [knative](https://github.com/knative)
- 📒 I, occasionally, work on my website, [CloudChowder](https://www.cloudchowder.com) which is intended to be a blog of my own thoughts and experiments as well as some info about me.
   - it is still under construction, for now. 
- 📫 Reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bishoygyoussef/).
